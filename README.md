### Introduction<br>
Welcome to the repository containing multiple data analysis projects! In these projects, we explore various data sets, perform data cleaning and preprocessing, and create informative visualizations to help uncover insights. The primary tools used are Python and Power BI, with an emphasis on using data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for Python, and advanced visualization and business intelligence techniques in Power BI.

### Project Overview
Each project in this repository covers a specific domain of analysis. Examples of what you will find in this repository include:<br>

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python<br>
Visualization of complex datasets<br>
Business Dashboards and Data Reports using Power BI<br>
The projects involve datasets across different industries and provide insights through interactive visualizations and detailed analysis.<br>

### Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis and visualization.<br>
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, SciPy, etc.<br>
Power BI: For business intelligence and creating interactive dashboards.<br>
Jupyter Notebooks: To document the analysis, code, and visualizations.<br>
Excel: For basic data exploration (if applicable).<br>

Each notebook file demonstrates different aspects of data analysis (e.g., exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb, data_visualization.ipynb, etc.).<br>

Each .pbix file corresponds to a specific project with visualizations created in Power BI.<br>
